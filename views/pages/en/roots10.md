The Costa Blanca unites an amazing range of environments and habitats arriving
from its famous beaches and coves to the leafy Woods and humid areas of its
mountains. However one of these environments is undoubtedly also the least
known. This area is particularly spectacular due to its impressive countryside.
We are talking about the **Montnegre valley, an authentic desert** in the heart
of the Costa Blanca.

To pass through this valley is to immerse yourself in a climate so dry where
rain is so rare through the year. However this desert countryside gives us such
great beauty. The **incredible range of shapes and colors** on offer capture you
at first sight.

Everything that we come across in this area its related to harsh climatic
conditions, its **vegetation and wildlife are unique**, as is its geology. That
said the is one element that leaps out about all others, intimately associated
with its history and inhabitants: **Water**, so very scarce as it is vital. We
shall continuous to stay away a very important fact in this area’s story, the
**Alicante’s allotment** where every type of top quality produce was grown for
centuries existed here. Traditional production still exists to maintain the
memory and flavour from times gone by and these can be enjoyed in the **region’s
fantastic gastronomy** which we will sampled at the end of our morning in a
specially selected restaurant.

Some would argue that Africa and her deserts do not begin in Morocco after
crossing the Gibraltar straits, but actually strait in the south of the Costa
Blanca.
