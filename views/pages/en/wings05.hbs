			<!-- Description -->
			<p>
				Here in the northern Costa Blanca we find one of the protected natural spaces of the region. A place where <b>water</b> is the absolute protagonist and the <b>cultivation of rice</b> is present in every corner of the culture.
			</p>
			<p> 
				The cultivation of rice was introduced to the region during the Arab period and its <b>story is a passionate one</b>. As you will discover during your visit as we discuss illness associated with wetland areas, its elaboration process or how in the 20th century rice was responsible for feeding children after the Spanish war. We are talking about extremely harsh conditions, <b>exhausting work</b> and incredible effort, something which is difficult to imagine these days. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Obviously rice cultivation has led to haute cuisine and it is no surprise that this area produces one of the varieties most valued by chefs throughout Europe. The <b>Bomba rice</b> is fundamental for the elaboration of many dishes in our gastronomy.
			</p>
			<p>
				The water of Marjal which for the most part comes from the <b>Gallinera Valley</b> flows with unique power and <b>transparency its extreme quality</b> permitting the existence of important animals and vegetation among which we find <b>water lilies</b>, the little protected fish <i>Samaruc</i> or colonies of <b>herons</b>. We are delighted to be able to show you this legacy.
			</p>
			<p>
				We will accompany you trhough the <b>canals and lagoons</b> of Marjal discovering its vegetation, birdlife, rice fields and narrating its hidden stories. The place where water decided to leave the earth and flood everything allowing us to enjoy one of the <b>most beautiful and unknown</b> enclaves of the Costa Blanca.
			</p>
			<p>
				To end our trip you might wish to extend your day by booking optionally visit a selected restaurant to enjoy the flavours of <b>traditional gastronomy</b> from the Costa Blanca, respecting the original methods used to create exceptional dishes. This is available at a extra charge.
