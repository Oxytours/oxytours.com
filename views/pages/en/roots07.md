Visible from almost anywhere along the Costa Blanca coastline, **Puig Campana**
emerges as an imposing colossus at a height of **1.410** metres and only **8**
kilometres from the Mediterranean sea it draws you like a magnet.

Visitors wonder at **Roldan’s cleft**, a spectacular cut in the mountain’s
silhouette. There are those who say that Roldan’s cleft was created naturally,
however legend says otherwise. A **giant’s rage** and his desperation to protect
his loved one caused the cleft hundreds of years ago. It is still said today
that at night under the moonlight you can hear Roldan’s sobs among the solitary
slopes.

Puig Campana is considered a **hiker’s Paradise** for those who visit the Costa
Blanca can contemplate the **best views** from its top. Without doubt on this
excursion with Oxytours you will discover it is so much more, a place where rare
**botanical species find shelter**, where we can easily observe **Barbary
sheep** and **Peregrine hawks** amaze you with their spectacular flight.

We will spend approximately 6 hours exploring this imposing mountain, naturally
with breaks to recharge our batteries and take in the breathtaking scenery. We
shall of course provide **snacks and homemade picnic food** using delicious
products typical of this area.

Roldan’s mountain tells us the tale of Marina Baixa, an agriculture and fishing
area which has turned into one of the main tourist destinations. Close to La
Nucia, Guadalest and Benidorm with **abundant sunshine, unique gastronomy,
exceptional environments and a culture legacy which** has given rise to this
astonishing region.
