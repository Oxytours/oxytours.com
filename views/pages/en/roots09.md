The first time you access **Hell’s gully** you feel overcome by a **strange
sensation, indeed it is almost mystical** as the countryside before you appears
not to be real. The banks of the dry river bed practically touch each other and
an **enormous amount of stone blocks** appear completely covered in white chalk.

It is almost as if an **uncontrollable force of torrential rain** has sculpted
this great passage, more than 15 kilometres in length. Undoubtedly impressive to
both visitors and inhabitants who must have thought it could only be the work of
the Devil, the interminable action of its water throughout thousands of years
has not only given rise to **gullies or ravines** but also various **caves**.
For example the **Rull’s cave**, a marvellous example of **stalactites and
stalagmites**.

This custom made excursion by **Oxytours will immerse you in the heart of the
mountain via its gullies** and singular vertical countryside. Before arriving we
will stroll through **paths of cultivation** to later on descend into the gully
by a narrow pathway set up by the **Arabs**.

The **gastronomy** of this area is in harmony with its villages and inhabitants.
Its **tranquility** rich not only in detail but also delightfully attacking your
senses arises from a **tradition** often lost. In addition you will be able to
learn how its cuisine is created as our **selected restaurant** will demonstrate
the **traditional cooking methods** as carried out by generations of locals and
so we take our tables to enjoy our well deserved mouthwatering food.

For this trip your camera is a must!

You will discover all this and more with Oxytours.
