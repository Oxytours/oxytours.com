			<!-- Description -->
			<p>
				Only <b>from the sea</b> is it possible to truly appreciate the true wonder of the <b>Serra Gelada terrestrial marine Natural Reserve</b>. We offer you the unique opportunity to board a sailing or motor boat to discover the secrets of the cliffs. This <b>fantastic experience</b> cannot be achieved any other way.
			</p>
			<p> 
				Having <b>embarked in Altea</b> we will sail to the feet of its <b>incredible cliffs</b> where we will come across the Serra Gelada <b>flora and fauna</b>, the highest <b>fossil dune in Europe</b>, the greatest presence of <b>Bottlenose dolphins</b> (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) in the Valencia region and know the existence of impressive marine plant named <i>Posidonia oceanica</i>.
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to contemplate the <b>cliff fisheries of Toix</b>, a true testimony to the tremendous difficulties encountered by the local population in the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century or, the remains of the <b>watchtowers</b> which alerted Altea  bay of <b>Berber pirate attacks</b> such as the terrifying <b>Dragut the Turk</b>, in the 16<sup>th</sup> century.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also have the chance to get to know Altea and Benidorm marine birdlife where depending on the time of year it is posible to see various protected species such as <b>Balearic searwather</b> (<i>Puffinus mauretanicus</i>) and <b>Mediterranean searwather</b> (<i>Calonectris diomedea</i>), <b>European storm-petrel</b> (<i>Hydrobates pelagicus</i>),  <b>Audouin’s Gull</b> (<i>Larus audouinii</i>), <b>Shag</b> (<i>Phalacrocorax aristotelis</i>) or <b>Northern gannet</b> (<i>Morus bassanus</i>). 
			</p>
			<p>
				As always with <b>Oxytours</b> we will enjoy the regions <b>delicious cuisine</b> and so we end our morning at a <b>handpicked restaurant</b> where we not only enjoy the <b>excellent flavour of traditional cooking</b> but also leave with the pleasant sensation that we have dined at home.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Without doubt, the best form to discover the Costa Blanca</b>.
