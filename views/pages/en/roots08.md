A mountain of Paradise in the heart of Alicante, **Serrella** is known as the
Little Alps of the Costa Blanca due to its impressive 15 kilometres in length
leading to **7 peaks of more than 1.300 metres** in height. All in all an
authentic mountain range in miniature.

Visiting Serrella is indeed a **pleasure for the senses** as they are seduced by
this mountain. The crystal sound of its waters or the song of **Red-billed
Chough**, the delightful smell of **aromatics flowers**, the sight of **Barbary
sheep** or even the cold touch of the chalky rocks **spectacular blocks of
stone** known as els _Frares_ (the friars).

This mountain encourages you to enjoy yourself at your leisure. Only in this way
will you discover the **history** that its **snow wells** narrate, together with
the many species of **bushes used by ancient inhabitants** to cure illness or
banish evil spirits.

We continue with this delight of the senses by visiting a specially **selected
restaurant** to enjoy the flavours of **traditional gastronomy** from this
region. Cuisine that has been brought about by a **fusion** of the various
cultures passing through the area and its **locally grown produces**.

You might wish to extend your day by booking a visit to an **olive oil press**.
This is available at a small extra charge. Here, we will sample its excellent
oils which have one won numerous international awards.
