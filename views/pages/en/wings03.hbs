			<!-- Description -->
			<p>
				The <b>spectacular mountain cliffs</b> include the <b>Serra Gelada Natural Reserve</b> offering more than 6 kilometres of astonishing countryside to take your breath away.
			</p>
			<p> 
				In the extreme north of this mountain we find the <b>Albir Lighthouse</b>, the only one you can access in this region. A gentle slope leads from the beach to the lighthouse moving through <b>beautiful coves</b> and giving <b>breathtaking views of Altea bay</b> and Peñon de Ifach. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Along this excursion you will discover why species such as the <b>Bottlenose dolphin and Posidonia seaplants</b>, which are vital to the Mediterranean conservation exist here. In addition, you will be able to see the unique <b>geological origins</b> of this area.

			</p>
			<p>
				Visiting the ochre mines or the remains of <b>watchtowers</b> you will be transported back to mediaeval <b>pirate attacks</b> during XV to XVIII centuries.
			</p>
			<p>
				To end our trip you might wish to extend your day by booking optionally visit a <b>selected restaurant</b> to enjoy the flavours of <b>traditional gastronomy</b> from the Costa Blanca, respecting the original methods used to create exceptional dishes. This is available at a extra charge.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fossil dunes, seabirds, dolphins, unique flora, spectacular views… A suitable route for all ages.
