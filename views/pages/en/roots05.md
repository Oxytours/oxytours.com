Emerging from the sea is the gigantic **Bernia mountain**, which stretches as
far as the **Tarbena valley**, reaching 1.129 metres in height.

We invite you to ascend its slope observing the countryside giving **unsurpassed
views** of Marina Alta, Marina Baixa as well as Alicanteâ€™s interior. On a clear
day we can even see the island of Ibiza.

Its proximity to the sea combined with its altitude makes Bernia one of the
greatest diverse habitats, unbelievable species of flora and fauna are found
only in this area.

The incredible stone vantage point made up of the mountain, itself and the
**16<sup>th</sup> century fortress** some 800 metres high, aimed to protect the
coastline from the constant **pirate attacks** which plagued this land as since
ancient times.

We visit the remains of this fortress to get to know its story,**wild orchids**
and the _Forat_, a natural orifice crossing the mountain from one face to the
other offering spectacular views of the entire region.

You will have the opportunity to discover **typical Alicante cuisine**, famous
throughout for its excellence. You may already be familiar with paella, however
we invite you to try various other **delicacies accompanied by good wine** of
course!

After lunch you might wish to extend your day by booking a visit to an
**excellent bodega** in order to sample its exquisite wines and olive oils. This
is available at a small extra charge.

In a nutshell: the perfect combination of hiking, nature, history, culture and
gastronomy to immerse yourself in the authentic Costa Blanca.
