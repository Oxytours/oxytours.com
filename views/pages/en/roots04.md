There has always been magic in the air as we explore mountain paths. This
sensation is difficult to explain but it’s exactly what is felt as we hike
through _Penya Foradà_.

Our route tell the tale of ancient villages and their inhabitants, working the
land and cultivating it opening tiny paths to unite the valleys. The **majestic
stone arc of Forada** spectacularly appears before us, inviting us to scale its
700 metres. Our reward is a **unique panorama** not to be found elsewhere on the
Costa Blanca. Most visitors never will witness its beauty.

In addition, you will discover why this area is included within **Natura 2000
Network**, an ecological network of European protected areas, thanks to its
numerous **important environmental values**. Among these are rock plants,
protected eagles and the Stone arc to name a few. The arc in particular is **one
of nature’s miracles**, twice a year the sun shines through to reveal the now
disappeared site of the Franciscan convent in Benitaia.

There is no better way to end the morning than speaking about what you have seen
and experienced in these wonderful surroundings while tasting the **excellent
cuisine**. We have selected a restaurant which upholds not only **artisan
traditions** but also the **quality of produce** found in this unique valley.

To end the trip journey excursion you might wish to extend your day by booking a
visit to a **Cherry Co-operative**. This is available at a small extra charge.
Here we will sample their produce, discovering its social and economic
important.
