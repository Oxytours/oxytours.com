The sleeping lion of **Ponoig mountain**was so named by **Gabriel Miró**, the
Alicante writer and poet at the start of 20th century. The peaks and curves of
this marvellous formation resemble the mane of a magnificent feline: the lions
head. Those who venture to discover the mountain which is in effect a true lion
formed by **peaks, deep ravines and an amazing watchtower peak at 1180 metres**
in height from where we observe an excellent panorama of the Costa Blanca will
not be disappointed.

Ponoig is without doubt a unique mountain. Its elevated height coupled with its
proximity to the Mediterranean has made it home to a series of distinct habitats
that house **numerous species of particularly interesting** plants and animals.
A biodiversity which turns this area into an environmental paradise.

The **Ponoig trails** tell us how its inhabitants lived, how they learnt the
medicinal properties of the plants on its slopes and also how they survived the
transformation this region has undergone during the last 50 years. The original
stone walls are still in evidence today to tell us the story.

Of all the tales that you will hear perhaps the most delightful will be the
silent one that you will feel with your senses: **the gastronomy**. We take you
to a restaurant which will take you on a veritable journey through the **area’s
traditions, flavours and wealth of produce**, respecting the original methods
used to create these exceptional dishes. You will be in no doubt as to why the
Costa Blanca is famed for its cuisine!

After lunch you might wish to extend your day by booking a visit to an
**excellent bodega** in order to sample its exquisite wines and olive oils. This
is available at a small extra charge.

You won’t regret booking with Oxytours. Seeing is believing.
