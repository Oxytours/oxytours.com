			<!-- Description -->
			<p>
				Each step taken in this mountain transports you back to <b>ancient times</b>, when the area’s inhabitants excavated hiking routes which joined their settlements. 
			</p>
			<p> 
				This marvellous land which is well preserved conjures up images of battles fought for castles through the valley.

			</p>
			<p>
				Its fountains and water reserves still feed life in <b>Al-Azraq, the last Moor vizier</b> in Valencia against the <b>Christian King Jaume I</b> in the 13<sup>th</sup> century.

			</p>
			<p>
				As you walk you will discover the <b>fertile valley</b>, it’s exceptional atmosphere including unique endemic botanical species. What’s more, it offers <b>Neolithic cave paintings</b> declared a <b>UNESCO site</b> in 1988.
				
			</p>
			<p>
				In the present day <b>cherry farming</b> is the base of the area’s economy and in spring the <b>breathtakingly beautiful blossom</b> covers the Valley in a white blanket. 

			</p>
			<p>
				However, it’s possible to enjoy this Valley all year round through its paths admiring the remains of the <b>Gallinera castle</b>, which still stands the test of time 800 years on.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is no better way to end the morning than speaking about what you have seen and experienced in these wonderful surroundings while tasting the <b>excellent cuisine</b>. We have selected a restaurant which upholds not only <b>artisan traditions</b> but also the <b>quality of produce</b> found in this unique valley.
			</p>
			<p>
				To end the trip journey excursion you might wish to extend your day by booking a visit to a <b>Cherry Co-operative</b>. This is available at a small extra charge. Here we will sample their produce, discovering its social and economic important.
			</p>
			<p>
				A fertile and welcoming valley. Discover it with Oxytours.
