Among the great mountains of the Costa Blanca lies a small jewel known as
**Xorta mountain**. Due to its 1.220 metres in height and imposing profile this
is often overshadowed by Serrella, Aitana or Bernia mountains.

That is perhaps why its richness is only sampled by these lucky enough to pass
through its trails. **The arch** itself is hidden but soon appears to surprised
hikers. Some **20 meters in height** with two openings separated by a narrow
column which looks as if it is about to fall into the Foies ravine. This is
without doubt a **natural wonder** of great geological and botanical importance.

Let **Oxytours** take you along **almond and olive groves**, at the feet of the
enormous vertical walls of Xorta. We then ascend to the top (according to the
fitness level) giving us **exceptional views** of Mediterranean sea, Guadalest
valley and neighbouring Aitana mountain. **Countryside of great beauty**
immortalised by the exceptional Works of the painter **Emilio Varela**, one of
the most important Alicante artists of the XX<sup>th</sup> century.

At the end of the hike **extraordinary cuisine** awaits you. As we visit a
restaurant hand selected by Oxytours. Here you will sample **traditional
flavours** which have evolved with time thanks to traditions and new trends
preserving the quality of products of this area.

After lunch you might wish to extend your day by booking a visit to an **artisan
workshop** to learn are prepared its famous handmade meat product named
_Sobrasada_.
